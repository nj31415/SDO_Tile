Implementation Notes:
- Setting --inet4-only option on wget, sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov does not seem to allow copying via IPv6, connections time out
- To set up the HyperPixel on Raspbian lite, must manually install the drivers and choose Pi 3 during install
	- https://github.com/pimoroni/hyperpixel4/issues/185
- PIGPIO allows for control of the back light using the pigs hp 19 100 50000 command
	- Setting the duty cycle (final value in command) controls the backlight
		- Going too low completely turns off the backlight
- FBI is forced to run in TTY2 using the -T 2 option
	- This allows the script to keep running in the ssh window without interruption by FBI
- Using root crontab (accessed using sudo crontab -e) to run sdo_auto_start.sh at reboot
	- The sdo_auto_start.sh script is configured for running in ALL CHANNEL DYNAMIC mode at 512 resolution
